# Delaunay Triangulation

This repository implements the Bowyer-Watson algorithm for Delaunay Triangulation.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation):
> In computational geometry, a Delaunay triangulation or Delone triangulation of a set of points in the plane subdivides their convex hull into triangles whose circumcircles do not contain any of the points. <br/> The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work "Sur la sphère vide" (On the empty sphere) from 1934.

The implementation is based on the pseudocode from the [Bowyer–Watson article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm#Pseudocode).
